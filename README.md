# Customer-Segmentation
<p>In this project, customers are required to be segmented according to the purchasing history obtained from the membership cards of a big mall.

This project is less challenging than other projects. After getting to know the data set quickly, you are expected to perform Exploratory Data Analysis. You should observe the distribution of customers according to different variables, also discover relationships and correlations between variables. Then you will spesify the different variables to use for cluster analysis.

The last step in customer segmentation is to group the customers into distinct clusters based on their characteristics and behaviors. One of the most common methods for clustering is K-Means Clustering, which partitions the data into k clusters based on the distance to the cluster centroids. Other clustering methods include hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and spectral clustering. Each cluster can be assigned a label that describes its main features and preferences.</p>
